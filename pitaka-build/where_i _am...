What has been done..and need to be done..

the one important thing not finished right now is the database issue
with dict selection priorities. that is the assignment and cleanup of meta.useid
when adding or deleting a dict.
i need to implement triggers when doing database creation, that automatically
update the latest useid. also when deleting an existing dict with a useid less than the last one
all dict with higher useid's need to be adjusted by decrementing their useid's.

Add and delete Dict Handlers are to be run as eclipse jobs with progress monitors. 
since those methods can take up considerable time and also will freeze the UI.

when searching for a definition, the output has to be formatted for multiple dicts.
also the sql statement needs to be changed so that the meta.used and meta.useid will
be taken into consideration when executing the statement.
